        The purpose of these assignments is to demonstrate proficiency in front-end technologies by designing and developing a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        The tasks are divided into two parts, focusing on different aspects of web development.
        In the first assignment, the objective is to create a presentation website for the group. The website must include at least three interconnected pages: a homepage 
        and two additional pages, preferably showcasing each group member. Each page should feature a bitmap image, an SVG image, and links to other pages, along with at least one 
        external link. The layout of the pages must be fully styled using CSS.
        The second assignment builds upon the first by enhancing user experience and enriching the websiteâ€™s content with advanced CSS3 and JavaScript features. This includes 
        implementing responsive web design and adding a login page. The login page should validate passwords based on specific criteria, such as including uppercase letters, numbers, 
        and special characters. Working on these assignments was both engaging and educational. The process of integrating design and functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        offered valuable hands-on experience. Exploring creative layouts, responsive design, and interactivity made this a particularly rewarding and interesting learning experience.
